# [Why Python?](/README.md)

These days Python is predominantly a language of science and
server-side engineering. It is great for writing systems that test
other systems. It is also one of the top languages used in data
sciences.

## Easy

Python is hands down the simplest language to learn of all the modern
main stream languages. This is why it is the first language students
at MIT learn and many other schools. The code looks a lot like how you
would write it out in simple English.

This ease makes Python extremely fast to program in, much faster
than most other languages. This makes Python the easy pick when
prototyping server-side applications and doing systems testing. The
[utility to generate this GitHub course text book][ghc] is a good
example, a little sloppy but coded in a matter of hours where other
languages would take longer.

## Everywhere

Well not *everywhere*. But anywhere there is a server there is
generally Python. One place it is not is in the web browser. Those
sites that have Python on the web are either using an interpreter
written in 

## Powerful

Python might not enjoy the raw execution speed of C or Go but the
reason it is a favorite among data analysts, physicists, and other
scientists is the ease with which core parts of the language,
modules, can be written in C++ or C and used just like any other
module. This allows bottlenecks created in prototype code (remember
the mantra *premature optimization is the root of all evil*) to be
addressed later allowing developers to create and design unfettered
from performance fears.

## Versatile

Although Python won out over Perl for its one-best-way approach
over Perl's more-than-one-way-to-do-it artistic approach there is
still a lot of flexibility in the language. One of the most interesting
areas is traditional object-oriented programming and function
programming. The two are alive and well in the same language. This
allows either design approach.

## Mature

Python has been around since the 90s and only gotten better. Unlike
other languages Python survived a full port from 2 to 3 with a lot of
“breaking changes.” It has taken literally years for people to adopt
3 and port important libraries to it but for the most part this is now
complete. The amount of existing libraries to about anything you can
imagine is astounding.

This level of maturity is somewhat rare in the tech world
and the value can’t be overstated. Python is hear to stay for a long
time to come.
