# [Fundamentals in Python][work]
[work]: https://github.com/skilstak/pyfun-work/blob/gh-pages/README.md

**Welcome to Python!** In this course you will learn the fundamentals
of programming in Python. Concepts include variables, operators,
blocks, logic, loops, data types, lists, dictionaries, functions,
exceptions, unit testing, classes, files, json, web api consumption,
and basic code organization.  You will learn modern Python 3 and we
encourage you to first learn this before possibly learning the older,
but still used, Python 2.

Read these first before jumping off into the projects:

1. [Why Python?](/why/README.md)
1. [Short History of Python](/history/README.md)

## Projects

* [Hello World! (`hello`)](hello)
* [Hi There! (`hi`)](hi)
* [Nyan, Nyan, STOP! (`nyan`)](nyan)
* [Do You Like Waffles? (`waffles`)](waffles)
* [Badgers, Badgers, Badgers (`badgers`)](badgers)
* [Magic Eightball (`eightball`)](eightball)
* [Bridge Keeper (`bridge`)](bridge)
* [Arrrguments](`arrrgs`)](arrrgs)
* [Dice Roll (`roll`)](roll)
* [Multiplication Tables (`mtable`)](mtable)
* [Mad Forms (`madforms`)](madforms)
* [Binary Counter (`bincount`)](bincount)
* [Quiz Game (`quiz`)](quiz)
* [Blinky Lib (`blinky`)](blinky)
* [Arena (`arena`)](arena)
* [Battleship (`battle`)](battle)
* [Pokeapi (`pokeapi`)](pokeapi)
* [Story Engine (`story`)](story)

## To Teachers

**Time and Scheduling:** The assignments in this course are designed
to fill about 90 minutes a week of class time for a little over 16
weeks (about one semester in most schools).

**Age:** The content is designed with students ages 8 to 18 in mind but has
been completed by college age students and adults as well.

**Just the Fundamentals:** It is important to note this course
covers only basic Programming Fundamentals that are pretty much
universal to all languages.  Python-specific features, such as
comprehensions, are not covered.

**Supplemental Project:** Ideally these assignments will be coupled
with an ongoing project of the student's choosing in which they can
apply what they are learning as well as display on their public
GitHub repo to the world demonstrating what they have learned. Such
a project would help motivate students to progress farther on their
own as they learn the more advanced features of Python.

**Rubrics:** This course contains no rubrics since these differ
greatly. At SkilStak we prefer to simply check for completion and
supplement this course with a
[certification](http://github.com/skilstak/course-pyfun-certification). In
fact, not unlike learning martial arts, many students may need to
repeat these assignments a few times to gain full mastery sufficient
to certify.

**Resources and Requirements:** Students need access to a Bash
command-line on a computer that has had `python3` installed. Usually
this will be through an `ssh` connection to a Linux account on a
central school server but could equally be done with
[codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com), individual Raspberry
Pi computers, personal Linux laptops, virtual machines, or a remote
virtual host such as [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

Students should be setup with `ssh` access to GitHub and minimally
familiar with GitHub and understand how to make changes and commit
them. The included [`bin/save`](bin/save) command can be used to help
simplify this process from the command line.

We have tried to keep everything needed for this course (except
Python3 itself and the Bash command line) included in the course repo.
This sometimes means some redundancy in each assignment directory but
felt it worth it to help students explore in those files as well. This
makes each assignment subdirectory as autonomous as possible.

We also assume students have been setup with `vim` and any system
settings for editing have been added to the system. The editor in
[codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com) is also very good for
those not wanting to hassle with `vim` setup and instruction.

**GitHub Classroom:** This course is setup to work well with
`classroom.github.com` and we encourage it. Because everything in
this repo is released to the public domain you should have no problem
setting up an "assignment" as follows for use with your own students.

Using GitHub classroom with private repos allows students to work
without the worry of being scrutinized by peers and the public. (We
don't worry about cheating so muchâ€”especially since the solutions
are all in `.solutions` of every assignment). This also keeps
students personal GitHub repos uncluttered with educational repos
that might dissuade a potential employer or school admission leaving
only the student's individual creations in their repos.

**Follow Up Possibilities:** This course is designed to prepare students to be proficient with
Raspberry Pi programming in Python later. Specifically the [*Blinky
Lib*](blinky) created can be modified to work with simple LED lights
from a basic breadboard connected to it.

Many of the command line skills also build into server-side scripting
from the command line in the Linux course where basic Ethical Hacking
is also introduced.

Go lang programming usually comes after this course as well since
students become familiar with command-line programming in Python
before moving on.
