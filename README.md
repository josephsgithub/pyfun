# Programming Fundamentals in Python 3

## What We Learn

In this course students find out what coding is, why they should
learn it, and how. Students focus on programming fundamentals such
as variables, operators, blocks, logic, loops, data types, lists,
dictionaries, functions, exceptions, unit testing, classes, files,
json, web api consumption, and basic code organization.

Students gradually learn the same habits, tools, and workflows
associated with college computer science programs and technical
careers. We code using `vim` from the command-line the way most
experienced professionals do. If you insist, you can also use the
[Atom](http://atom.io)-like editor with
[codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhwere.com).

Students learn modern Python (3.4+ not 2.7) for many obvious reasons.

## To Teachers

**Time and Scheduling:** The assignments in this course are designed
to fill about 90 minutes a week of class time for a little over 16
weeks (about one semester in most schools).

**Age:** The content is designed with students ages 8 to 18 in mind but has
been completed by college age students and adults as well.

**Just the Fundamentals:** It is important to note this course
covers only basic Programming Fundamentals that are pretty much
universal to all languages.  Python-specific features, such as
comprehensions, are not covered.

**Supplemental Project:** Ideally these assignments will be coupled
with an ongoing project of the student's choosing in which they can
apply what they are learning as well as display on their public
GitHub repo to the world demonstrating what they have learned. Such
a project would help motivate students to progress farther on their
own as they learn the more advanced features of Python.

**Rubrics:** This course contains no rubrics since these differ
greatly. At SkilStak we prefer to simply check for completion and
supplement this course with a
[certification](http://github.com/skilstak/course-pyfun-certification). In
fact, not unlike learning martial arts, many students may need to
repeat these assignments a few times to gain full mastery sufficient
to certify.

**GitHub Classroom:** This course is setup to work well with
`classroom.github.com` and we encourage it. Because everything in
this repo is released to the public domain you should have no problem
setting up an "assignment" as follows for use with your own students.

Using GitHub classroom with private repos allows students to work
without the worry of being scrutinized by peers and the public. (We
don't worry about cheating so muchâ€”especially since the solutions
are all in `.solutions` of every assignment). This also keeps
students personal GitHub repos uncluttered with educational repos
that might dissuade a potential employer or school admission leaving
only the student's individual creations in their repos.

**Follow Up Possibilities: ** 
This course is designed to prepare students to be proficient with
Raspberry Pi programming in Python later. Specifically the [*Blinky
Lib*](blinky) created can be modified to work with simple LED lights
from a basic breadboard connected to it.

Many of the command line skills also build into server-side scripting
from the command line in the Linux course where basic Ethical Hacking
is also introduced.

Go lang programming usually comes after this course as well since
students become familiar with command-line programming in Python
before moving on.
