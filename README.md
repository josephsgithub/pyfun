# Programming Fundamentals in Python 3

![bloomberg](assets/bloomberg.png)

## What We Learn

In this course students find out what coding is, why they should
learn it, and how. Students focus on programming fundamentals such
as variables, operators, blocks, logic, loops, data types, lists,
dictionaries, functions, exceptions, unit testing, classes, files,
json, web api consumption, and basic code organization.

Students gradually learn the same habits, tools, and workflows
associated with college computer science programs and technical
careers. We code using `vim` from the command-line the way most
experienced professionals do. If you insist, you can also use the
[Atom](http://atom.io)-like editor with
[codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhwere.com).

Students learn modern Python (3.4+ not 2.7) for many obvious reasons.
