# Welcome Teachers!

> Whether you are a SkilStak™ senior student who has become a student
> instructor, a teacher from a public or private school, a university
> adjunct, or even from a corporate organization we welcome you and
> hope you find this material useful. Like all courses and
> learning modules at SkilStak™ each has a ***textbook*** and ***workbook***
> GitHub repo. The *textbook* is for reference. The *workbook* is to be
> used as a starter “assignment” repo for [GitHub Classroom][classroom].
> You may wish to read more about using [*GitHub Classroom as Textbook
> and Workbook*][text-work] to familiarize yourself with this approach.
> We believe it is the future of all textbooks in education as the
> OER movement continues and classrooms become more digital.

## Prerequisites

* Complete [Prep](http://prep.skilstak.io)

## Age

The content is designed with students ages 8 to 18 in mind but has
been completed by college age students and adults as well.

## Time

Students stay in this course until they are
[*certified*](http://certify.skilstak.io).  Our experience has shown
the average student can certify after about 100 total hours of time
invested in learning and practicing. The amount of time required
to certify will vary dramatically between individuals and has more
to do with the amount of practice students get outside of class
than aptitude or age.

There are only 16 weeks of 90-minute classes in a semester totaling
24 classroom hours 4 of which are *digital recess* time. It is
important to be realistic about how much mastery can be learned in
only 20 total hours of class time, yet this is still 20 times more
than most students get anywhere else.

Therefore, it should take students who do not do any work outside of
class five semesters (that’s two years if they attend all three
semesters). If a student spends 90 minutes at home working on stuff
outside of class that reduces the time in half, about one year. And if
the student spends three hours outside of class (and many spend *way*
more than that) it is realistic to see them certify in one semester.

We recommend focusing on incentives and motivation for students to work
on course projects or their own spin offs to maintain what they
learn through the week to get them as many hours as possible outside
of class.

## Rubrics

There are no rubrics other than instructor review of completed
course projects. All the solutions are available in the textbook
so [certification](http://certify.skilstak.io) is the main assessment
tool.

## Resources

Students need access to a **Bash command-line** on a computer that has
had **`python3`** installed. Usually this will be through an **`ssh`**
connection to a Linux account on a central school server but could
equally be done with [codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com),
individual Raspberry Pi computers, personal Linux laptops, virtual
machines, or a remote virtual host such as [Digital
Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

## Other

Fundamentals is just that, fundamentals. Python comprehensions are
not a fundamental. Avoid the tendency to lose focus on the advanced
elements of Python at the expense of the fundamentals. There will
be plenty of time to explore the rest in
[Project](http://project.skilstak.io) after they certify.

## Next

After [certifying](http://certify.skilstak.io) students move to
[Project](http://project.skilstak.io) where they are prepared to
do learning modules from the [Engineering](http://eng.skilstak.io),
[Linux](http://linux.skilstak.io), [Data Science](http://data.skilstak.io),
and [Languages](http://lang.skilstak.io) focus categories.
