# Teachers’ Welcome

Thanks for using this textbook repo. It has an accompanying workbook
repo as well that should be used as a starter repo for a 
[GitHub Classroom][classroom]. You may wish you read more about
using [*GitHub Classroom as Textbook and Workbook*][text-work]

 -weeks (about one semester in most schools).
 -
 -**Age:** The content is designed with students ages 8 to 18 in mind but has
 -been completed by college age students and adults as well.
 -
 -**Just the Fundamentals:** It is important to note this course
 -covers only basic Programming Fundamentals that are pretty much
 -universal to all languages.  Python-specific features, such as
 -comprehensions, are not covered.
 -
 -**Supplemental Project:** Ideally these assignments will be coupled
 -with an ongoing project of the student's choosing in which they can
 -apply what they are learning as well as display on their public
 -GitHub repo to the world demonstrating what they have learned. Such
 -a project would help motivate students to progress farther on their
 -own as they learn the more advanced features of Python.
 -
 -**Rubrics:** This course contains no rubrics since these differ
 -greatly. At SkilStak we prefer to simply check for completion and
 -supplement this course with a
 -[certification](http://github.com/skilstak/course-pyfun-certification). In
 -fact, not unlike learning martial arts, many students may need to
 -repeat these assignments a few times to gain full mastery sufficient
 -to certify.
 -
 -**Resources and Requirements:** Students need access to a Bash
 -command-line on a computer that has had `python3` installed. Usually
 -this will be through an `ssh` connection to a Linux account on a
 -central school server but could equally be done with
 -[codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com), individual Raspberry
 -Pi computers, personal Linux laptops, virtual machines, or a remote
 -virtual host such as [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).
 -
 -Students should be setup with `ssh` access to GitHub and minimally
 -familiar with GitHub and understand how to make changes and commit
 -them. The included [`bin/save`](bin/save) command can be used to help
 -simplify this process from the command line.
 -
 -We have tried to keep everything needed for this course (except
 -Python3 itself and the Bash command line) included in the course repo.
 -This sometimes means some redundancy in each assignment directory but
 -felt it worth it to help students explore in those files as well. This
 -makes each assignment subdirectory as autonomous as possible.
 -
 -We also assume students have been setup with `vim` and any system
 -settings for editing have been added to the system. The editor in
 -[codeanywhere.com](http://codeanywhere.com) is also very good for
 -those not wanting to hassle with `vim` setup and instruction.
 -
 -**GitHub Classroom:** This course is setup to work well with
 -`classroom.github.com` and we encourage it. Because everything in
 -this repo is released to the public domain you should have no problem
 -setting up an "assignment" as follows for use with your own students.

 -
 -Using GitHub classroom with private repos allows students to work
 -without the worry of being scrutinized by peers and the public. (We
 -don't worry about cheating so much—especially since the solutions
 -are all in `.solutions` of every assignment). This also keeps
 -students personal GitHub repos uncluttered with educational repos
 -that might dissuade a potential employer or school admission leaving
 -only the student's individual creations in their repos.
 -
 -**Follow Up Possibilities:** This course is designed to prepare students to be proficient with
 -Raspberry Pi programming in Python later. Specifically the [*Blinky
 -Lib*](blinky) created can be modified to work with simple LED lights
 -from a basic breadboard connected to it.
 -
 -Many of the command line skills also build into server-side scripting
 -from the command line in the Linux course where basic Ethical Hacking
 -is also introduced.
 -
 -Go lang programming usually comes after this course as well since
 -students become familiar with command-line programming in Python
 -before moving on.
