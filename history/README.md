# [⏪ Short History of Python](/README.md)

> This summary of Python history is by no means complete, just an
> overview.

## Guido's Christmas Present Named After Monty Python

Python was created in 1989 over Christmas when Guido van Rossum
wanted something fun to do. A Monty Python fan, (aren’t we all), he
decided to give his “hobby” language the namesake. He states he
specifically wanted to “appeal to UNIX/C hackers” and given that
Perl was the dominate server-side web programming language probably
wanted something a bit more robust for larger projects. Turns out
the rest of the world would eventually agree. For that time Python
was the new kid on the block.  Where Perl took the creative
there-is-more-than-one-way-to-do-it approach Python took the
enterprise-friendly, there-is-one-best-way-to-do-it approach. The
rivalry was fierce but in the end most would agree Python won.
Google loved Python so much they hired Guido for a time. (Some even
say Go lang, another language from Google, was created as a sort
of compiled Python.)

> for one-liners much like the `sed` and `awk` equivalents `perl` was
> originally designed to replace, but Python has garnered the trust
> of many enterprises so much that they have even replaced the much
> more formal Java with Python.

## Whitespace Novelty

Python was really the first language to use whitespace as a part
of the language.  This was really jarring and unheard of at the
time. Today whitespace is commonly accepted as a part of syntax by
many other languages.

## Best First Language to Learn

Many blogs and articles have been written confirming this but perhaps
the biggest example was when MIT dropped Java for Python for
beginners.  Around 2010 MIT decided to make Python the first language
to learn.  They are not the only ones. Many educational institutions
have adopted Python as the first language any programming student
learns.

It is really unfortunate the makers of the AP Computer Science exam
have not yet seen the practicality of moving as well. The awkward
subset of Java remains the basis for all APCS material and test as
does the now very outdated emphasis on single-inheritance over
composition, but that is a conversation for another day.
