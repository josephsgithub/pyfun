# Short History of Python

This summary of Python history is by no means complete, just an
overview.

Most Python usage was server-side including stuff in connection
with web servers (not browsers). This is why we say “back end”
language.

Perl was Python’s main competitor and predecessor, which dominated
server-side programming for years in the late 90s and early 2000s.
For that time Python was the new kid on the block.  Where Perl took
the creative “there is more than one way to do it” Python took the
“there is only one way to do it” approach. The rivalry was fierce but
in the end most would agree Python won. Perl is still a fantastic
shell programming language, however, with a much better syntax for
shell one-liners much like the `sed` and `awk` equivalents `perl` was
originally designed to replace.

## Whitespace Novelty 

Python was really the first language to use whitespace as a part
of the language.  This was really jarring and unheard of at the
time. Today whitespace is commonly accepted as a part of syntax by
many other languages.

## Adopted as Best First Language to Learn

Around 2010 MIT decided to make Python the first language to learn.
Previously it had been Java. They are not the only ones. Many
educational institutions have adopted Python as the first language
any programming student learns.

Unfortunately the makers of the AP Computer Science exam still fail to
see Python as an alternative to Java for all their material and test.
