# [When Not to Pick Python](/README.md)

Like any technology Python has its sweet spots and square peg
challenges. The [sweet spots](/why/README.md) convince many to use
Python but let's talk about the square pegs for a bit.

## Concurrency

Python shows its age a bit on this front. While there are a lot of add
ons good concurrency is not fundamentally built into the language.
’Dems fightin’ words to a log of Python supports but it is simply
true. JavaScript gets around this in its own asynchronous way, which
can be added onto Python as well. Go has perhaps one of the best
concurrency models that is abstracted from the underlying operating
system.

## Not a Web Language

Python can run in the browser thanks to many remarkable JavaScript
implementations of Python interpreters but at its heart is not a
web language. This does not mean it is not used for the web, only
that running Python in a web browser directly is impossible. Python
is, however, one of the main server-side languages although it is
losing ground to Node and Go as the [JAMStack.org](http://jamstack.org)
model becomes more mainstream.
